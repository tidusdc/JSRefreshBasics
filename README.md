# JSRefreshBasics
This are just some test questions and exercises I have gone through to refresh my knowledge in Javascript and JS principles.

I am not claiming any of this work to be my own.

Many of these questions have been obtained from other developers and instructors on the web.

Many of the answers are my own variations, but I am not claiming any of them as my own property. These are simply my attempts to answer sample questions and learn these principles.

I have answered them to the best of my ability, and this repo is simply to track my progress with refreshing my knowledge with JS.
